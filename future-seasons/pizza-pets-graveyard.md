# 🪦 Pizza Pets Graveyard

Welcome to the **Pizza Pets Graveyard**—the eternal resting place for all fallen Pizza Pets. When a pet dies, it is **permanently removed** from the collection, contributing to the game’s unique deflationary mechanics.

## 🪦 Dead Pets Are Gone Forever

Pizza Pets that have died are **forever removed** from circulation. They cannot be resurrected, traded, or played with. This permanence is part of the core design of Pizza Pets, ensuring the ecosystem remains dynamic and focused on survival and strategy.

Ralf might argue this is all part of the grand conspiracy by Ninjalerts to control the Pizza Pets world, while Pizza Ninjas might see it as a lesson in vigilance and sound strategy. Regardless of who you side with, the Bitcoin ethos of immutability ensures there’s no going back once a pet has been lost.

## 🍕 The Role of the Graveyard

The graveyard is more than just a final resting place—it’s a testament to the challenges and stakes of the game:

* **Strategic Survival**: Losing pets permanently means every decision matters, whether it’s feeding, applying lotion, or managing poop.
* **Deflationary Impact**: With every pet lost, the remaining ones grow rarer and potentially more valuable, much like Bitcoin’s fixed supply.
* **A Community Reflection**: The graveyard represents the collective struggles and triumphs of the Pizza Pets community.

## 💡 Could the Graveyard Be More?

We’d love to hear your thoughts! Could the Pizza Pets Graveyard evolve into something bigger? A commemorative space? A gameplay mechanic? Or perhaps something completely unexpected?

Would a more interactive or thematic graveyard be a good idea? We’d love community feedback on how this space could grow and contribute to the Pizza Pets experience.

Who knows? Maybe Ralf’s obsession with moon cheese or his vendetta against Ninjalerts will lead to something unexpected in the graveyard’s future!

## 🐾 A Sobering Reminder

The Pizza Pets Graveyard is a reflection of the game’s deflationary nature, where only the most strategic players can keep their pets alive. Like the legendary story of Bitcoin Pizza Day, every loss in the Pizza Pets world becomes part of its history.

While it’s sad to lose a pet, their legacy shapes the game’s value and future. The graveyard stands as a reminder: in Pizza Pets, survival isn’t just a game—it’s an art. 🍕🐾
