# 📐 Game Overview

## The World of Pizza Pets 🍕🐾

Welcome to the wild, wacky, and deflationary world of **Pizza Pets**—a game where your Tamagotchi-style digital pet lives (or dies) based on how much love, care, and pizza you’re willing to give. It’s not just a game; it’s a blockchain experiment where **crypto meets critters**, with stakes higher than a ninja pizza toss.

## The Basics: Care or Despair 😱

In **Pizza Pets**, you’re not just a pet owner—you’re a lifeline. Ignore your pets, and they’ll perish. And when they’re gone, they’re _really gone_. Dead pets are removed from the collection forever. No revivals, no respawns, no crypto hacks to get them back.

Case in point? The infamous **Pizza Pets Halving** on December 19, 2024. Over **30,000 pets** bit the dust, slashing the population in half and sending surviving pet values soaring faster than Bitcoin in a bull run. Brutal? Sure. But hey, scarcity is what makes things valuable in crypto, right?

## How It Works: Hearts, Pizza, and Poop 💔🍕💩

At its core, the game is simple:

* Pets **lose 1 heart per day**.
* To keep them alive, feed them **Pizza** or **Beer**:
  * **🍕 Pizza:** Restores 1 heart but increases the chance of poop by 23%.
  * **🍺 Beer:** Restores 2 hearts but cranks poop probability up to 69%.

Here’s the kicker: if your pet poops and you don’t clean it up, their health decline speeds up to **1.4 hearts per day**. Poop in the baby stage appears instantly after feeding (because babies, right?), while at later stages, it shows up randomly within 7 days.

To fix this, you’ll need to **🚿 Shower your pet**, reducing the health decline back to 1 heart per day. Lesson learned? Beer’s fun, but poop’s a problem.

## The Clock is Ticking ⏳

Season 1 of Pizza Pets spans **10,368 Bitcoin blocks**—about **72 days** based on the average 10-minute block time. With the game starting on **December 14, 2024**, Season 1 is expected to end on **February 24, 2025**. That’s your window to nurture, evolve, and keep your pets alive.

Remember: every block mined is one step closer to victory—or to the graveyard of neglected pets.

## Advanced Mechanics: Pizza Ninjas Play Dirty 🥷🍕

The game isn’t just about feeding and cleaning. For those bold enough, there are some advanced (and a little shady) mechanics:

* **Performance-Enhancing Drugs (PEDs):** Boost your pet’s stats for competitive play.
* **State-Altering Drugs:** Because why not add some chaos?
* **The Pet Pulverizer:** If you’re feeling particularly ruthless, this handy tool lets you send pets straight to the blockchain abyss. (Don’t worry, we’ll cover this in more detail later.)

## Why Play? The Deflationary Dream 🌟

Every decision matters in **Pizza Pets**, making it as much a game of strategy as it is a game of survival. With its deflationary mechanics, the longer your pets live, the more valuable they become. It’s like Bitcoin mining, but instead of hash rates, you’re managing poop rates.

So gear up, grab some pizza, and dive into the blockchain’s quirkiest game. Your pets—and your Ordinals portfolio—are counting on you! 🍕🐾
