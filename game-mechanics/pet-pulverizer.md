## üïµÔ∏è What We Know So Far

The **Pet Pulverizer** is a weapon created by Ralf, driven by his vendetta against Ninjalerts Corp. and the Pizza Pets ecosystem. Designed to target pets based on their **Pineapple Weakness**, it operates in two critical phases: **Trigger** and **Detonation**.

### New Details:
1. **First Auction Complete**: The Yellow Pulverizer was auctioned and is now owned by @PipeAliens.  
2. **Upcoming Auctions**: The White Pineapple Pulverizer auction is today, with more colors to follow.  
3. **48-Block Connection**: Previous speculation linked Pulverizers to 48 blocks; however, it‚Äôs now confirmed that they detonate **72 blocks** after being triggered.  

{% hint style="warning" %}
Stay alert: Future Pulverizers will target pets with other Pineapple Weakness colors (e.g., Green, Red, Blue). Owners must remain vigilant to protect their pets.

## üçï The Pulverizer Process: Trigger and Detonation

### Trigger
When a Pulverizer is triggered:
- A pineapple icon matching the Pulverizer‚Äôs color (e.g., Yellow) will appear on all pets.
- Notifications will be posted on X and apps like [Mind Your Milk](https://www.mindyourmilk.pizza/) will send alerts.

At this stage, **do not panic** or apply Lotion immediately. Why? Because detonation doesn‚Äôt occur until **72 blocks (~12 game-hours)** after the trigger block.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bitcoin blocks are typically mined every 10 minutes, meaning **72 blocks** could take ~12 hours. However, block times can vary significantly, so always monitor closely.
{% endhint %}

### Detonation
When the Pulverizer detonates, it will kill pets without Lotion that match its Pineapple Weakness color.  
- **Example**: The Yellow Pulverizer will kill pets with **Yellow Pineapple Weakness** unless protected with Lotion.  
- **Safe Pets**:
  - Pets with a Pineapple Weakness of a **different color**.  
  - Pets with **Immunity** or in evolution stages **Egg**, **Baby**, **Child**, or **Immortal**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protecting Your Pets

The only way to protect vulnerable pets is by applying **Lotion**. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

### When and How to Apply Lotion
1. **Wait Before Applying**: Lotion lasts for **36 blocks**, so don‚Äôt apply it immediately after the trigger block.  
2. **Timing Recommendation**: Apply Lotion when:
   - **40+ blocks have passed** since the trigger block.  
   - **Detonation is ‚â§32 blocks away**.  

This ensures Lotion will last through the detonation block and provide a 4-block buffer. Avoid waiting until the last few blocks, as block times can vary, putting pets at risk.

### FAQ: Common Pulverizer Questions

- **Can I stack Lotion?**  
  No, Lotion cannot be stacked.  

- **Do I need to apply Lotion to all pets?**  
  No, only apply Lotion to pets matching the Pineapple Weakness color of the triggered Pulverizer.  

- **Is my pet on LSD safe from the Pulverizer?**  
  No, pets on LSD still require Lotion for protection.

- **What happens if I give Milk to a pet?**  
  Feeding Milk removes all active drug effects, including Lotion. If Milk is given within 36 blocks of detonation, you must reapply Lotion immediately to maintain protection.
