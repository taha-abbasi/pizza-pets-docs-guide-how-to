## 🍕 The Story Behind the Pulverizer

Ralf’s journey is one of betrayal and revenge. After his pitch for Pizza Pets was dismissed (and allegedly stolen) by Ninjalerts Corp., Ralf vowed to take back what he believes is rightfully his. Operating from his Lunar City lair, he’s turned his heartbreak and obsession with pineapple on pizza into a vendetta. 

In his own words, from his final journal entries:

> "I’ve started working on a new invention — the Pet Pulverizer. While analyzing the Pizza Pets code, I found a backdoor left by Ninjalerts Corp. It’s careless work, but it’s exactly what I need. I can exploit it to hack into every Pizza Pet and destroy them all. It’s poetic, really — they stole my idea, so I’ll take it back by burning it all down."

Ralf’s actions are divisive: some see him as a hero, standing up to a corporate giant, while others see him as the villain, threatening to destroy the beloved Pizza Pets.
