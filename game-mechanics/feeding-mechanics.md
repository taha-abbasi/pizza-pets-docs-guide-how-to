# 🍕 Feeding Mechanics

## The Heart of the Matter 💔

In the world of Pizza Pets, **hearts are life**—literally. Pets lose **1 heart ❤️ per day** in normal circumstances, but under certain conditions, this rate can increase. For example:  
- **💩 Uncleaned poop** boosts the heart loss rate to **1.4 hearts ❤️ per day** for each poop.  
- **💪 Steroids** can also accelerate heart decline (we’ll cover this in Advanced Strategies).  

Thankfully, there are ways to reduce heart loss too. Ever heard of a pet that loves **☕ coffee** and **🌿 weed**? Yep, these special items can slow down heart loss, but again, that’s for the **Advanced Strategies** section. For now, let’s talk about how to keep your pets alive and kicking with proper feeding!

## The Two Staples of Pizza Pet Cuisine 🍕🍺

Your Pizza Pets don’t ask for much—just a steady diet of **Pizza** and **Beer**. Both are lifesavers, but they come with their own quirks. Let’s dig in:

### 🍕 Pizza
- **Effect:** Gains **+1 heart ❤️**.  
- **Side Effect:** Increases chance of **💩 poop** by **23%**.  
- **Perfect For:** A small, safe heart boost with lower poop risk.  

Think of Pizza as the trusty **Bitcoin** of pet feeding—reliable and always there for you when times are tough.

### 🍺 Beer
- **Effect:** Gains **+2 hearts ❤️❤️**.  
- **Side Effect:** Increases chance of **💩 poop** by **69%**.  
- **Perfect For:** A big heart boost, but tread carefully—this is the **Pump.fun** of feeding mechanics, powerful but sometimes unpredictable.

## Watching for Poop 💩

Feeding your pet is only half the battle; you’ve got to keep an eye out for poop. Here’s how it works based on your pet’s **evolution stage**:

### Baby Stage 🍼
- If a baby pet poops after a feed, it happens **immediately**. No waiting, no suspense.  
- If the baby **doesn’t poop immediately**, you’re in the clear until the next feed.  

Baby pets are like **free & fair crypto tokens like $DOG**—what you see is what you get. No hidden surprises!

---

### Child, Teen, and Adult Stages 🧒🧑🦸‍♂️
- In these stages, pets can poop **randomly within 7 days** of being fed.  
- You’ll need to **watch for the 💩 poop icon** on your pet and clean it as soon as it appears.

These stages are a bit more unpredictable—kind of like **corporate venture-backed and insider and special interest infested meme coins** on the market. You never know when things are going to go south, so stay vigilant!

## The Consequences of Poop 🤢

Poop isn’t just gross—it’s dangerous. Here’s why:  
- When a pet poops, its **heart loss rate increases to 1.4 hearts ❤️💕 per day**.  
- Poops can **stack**, meaning each additional poop multiplies the heart loss rate. For example:  
  - **1 poop = 1.4 hearts ❤️💕/day**  
  - **2 poops = 2.8 hearts ❤️❤️💕/day**  
  - **3 poops = 4.2 hearts ❤️❤️❤️❤️💕/day**  

Letting poop stack is like leaving your Bitcoin private keys unguarded—it’s a disaster waiting to happen. **Satoshi would never do that, why would you?**
