# 🍕 Feeding Mechanics

## The Heart of the Matter 💔

In the world of Pizza Pets, **hearts are life**—literally. Pets lose **1 heart per day** in normal circumstances, but under certain conditions, this rate can increase. For example:  
- **Uncleaned poop** boosts the heart loss rate to **1.4 hearts per day** for each poop.  
- **Steroids** can also accelerate heart decline (we’ll cover this in Advanced Strategies).  

Thankfully, there are ways to reduce heart loss too. Ever heard of a pet that loves coffee and weed? Yep, these special items can slow down heart loss, but again, that’s for the **Advanced Strategies** section. For now, let’s talk about how to keep your pets alive and kicking with proper feeding!

## The Two Staples of Pizza Pet Cuisine 🍕🍺

Your Pizza Pets don’t ask for much—just a steady diet of **Pizza** and **Beer**. Both are lifesavers, but they come with their own quirks. Let’s dig in:

### 🍕 Pizza
- **Effect:** Gains **1 heart**.  
- **Side Effect:** Increases chance of poop by **23%**.  
- **Perfect For:** A small, safe heart boost with lower poop risk.  

Think of Pizza as the trusty Bitcoin of pet feeding—reliable and always there for you when times are tough.

### 🍺 Beer
- **Effect:** Gains **2 hearts**.  
- **Side Effect:** Increases chance of poop by **69%**.  
- **Perfect For:** A big heart boost, but tread carefully—this is the Ethereum of feeding mechanics, powerful but sometimes unpredictable.

## Watching for Poop 💩

Feeding your pet is only half the battle; you’ve got to keep an eye out for poop. Here’s how it works based on your pet’s **evolution stage**:

### Baby Stage 🍼
- If a baby pet poops after a feed, it happens **immediately**. No waiting, no suspense.  
- If the baby **doesn’t poop immediately**, you’re in the clear until the next feed.  

Baby pets are like new crypto tokens—what you see is what you get. No hidden surprises!

---

### Child, Teen, and Adult Stages 🧒🧑🦸‍♂️
- In these stages, pets can poop **randomly within 7 days** of being fed.  
- You’ll need to **watch for the poop icon** on your pet and clean it as soon as it appears.

These stages are a bit more unpredictable—kind of like meme coins on the market. You never know when things are going to go south, so stay vigilant!

## The Consequences of Poop 🤢

Poop isn’t just gross—it’s dangerous. Here’s why:  
- When a pet poops, its **heart loss rate increases to 1.4 hearts per day**.  
- Poops can **stack**, meaning each additional poop multiplies the heart loss rate. For example:  
  - **1 poop = 1.4 hearts/day**  
  - **2 poops = 2.8 hearts/day**  
  - **3 poops = 4.2 hearts/day**  

Letting poop stack is like leaving your Bitcoin private keys unguarded—it’s a disaster waiting to happen.

## Why Poop Management Matters 🚿

Keeping an eye on poop and cleaning it promptly is crucial to your pet’s survival. Think of it as maintaining your crypto portfolio—regular attention and action keep things from falling apart. Or, if you’re a lazy Pizza Ninja, maybe you’ll lean on those **advanced techniques** to protect against heart decline. Either way, clean pets are happy pets.
