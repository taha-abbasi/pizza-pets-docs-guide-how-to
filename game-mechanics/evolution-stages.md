## Evolution Chart 📊

The table below outlines the time required for each stage of evolution. It also includes accelerated times with the use of **roids (PEDs)**, though specific strategies for roids will be covered in the **Advanced Strategies** section.

| **Evolution Stage** | **Blocks** | **Days** | **Hours** | **Blocks (With Roids)** | **Days (With Roids)** | **Hours (With Roids)** |

## Evolution Mechanics 🔧

The evolution process happens automatically as blocks are mined and your pet accumulates the required time in each stage. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Egg to Baby**: All Pizza Pets start as eggs and hatch into babies after **288 blocks** (~2 days).  
- **Stage Transitions**: Each stage transition requires a set number of blocks to complete, as shown in the chart.  
- **Immortal Stage**: Reaching the Immortal stage is the ultimate goal, unlocking unique traits and high value.

## Factors That Affect Evolution 📈📉

### Acceleration: PEDs like Roids
Certain items, such as **roids (Performance Enhancing Drugs)**, can speed up the evolution process. For example:
- Using roids reduces the block requirements for stage transitions by **33%**, as shown in the “Blocks (With Roids)” column above.

### Slowdowns: SADs and Other Factors
Other items, such as **State Altering Drugs (SADs)**, can **pause or slow down evolution**. For instance:
- **DMT**: Temporarily pauses the game, freezing evolution progress during its effect.

We’ll explore these items and strategies in more detail in the **Advanced Strategies** section.

## Evolution and the Bigger Picture 🌟

Reaching the Immortal stage within Season 1 is a significant achievement. It requires planning, efficient use of game actions, and a clear understanding of how evolution works. While items like **DMT** and **roids** can provide advantages or introduce complexities, mastering these mechanics is key to thriving in Pizza Pets.
