# 🪄 Evolution Stages

## 🌟 Evolution Stages Explained

Pizza Pets are more than just static collectibles—they’re living digital pets that grow and evolve through various stages. The evolution process is tied to **Bitcoin block times**, creating a unique and dynamic gameplay experience.

***

## Evolution Stages and Timeline ⏳

There are **six evolution stages** in Pizza Pets:

1. **Egg**
2. **Baby**
3. **Child**
4. **Teen**
5. **Adult**
6. **Immortal**

The total time it takes for a Pizza Pet to reach the **Immortal stage** (without acceleration or roids) is approximately **72 days**, aligned with the length of **Season 1**. The game began on **December 14, 2024**, and with an expected average of 10 minutes per Bitcoin block, Season 1 will conclude 72 days later, on **February 24, 2025**.

## Evolution Chart 📊

The table below outlines the time required for each stage of evolution. It also includes accelerated times with the use of **roids (PEDs)**, though specific strategies for roids will be covered in the **Advanced Strategies** section.

**Assumption:** Bitcoin blocks are mined every 10 minutes on average. Real block times may vary.

## Evolution Mechanics 🔧

The evolution process happens automatically as blocks are mined and your pet accumulates the required time in each stage. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Egg to Baby**: All Pizza Pets start as eggs and hatch into babies after **288 blocks** (\~2 days).
* **Stage Transitions**: Each stage transition requires a set number of blocks to complete, as shown in the chart.
* **Immortal Stage**: Reaching the Immortal stage is the ultimate goal, unlocking unique traits and high value.  
    - Collecting all **11 types of pets** and evolving them to Immortal will give you the ability to breed **new pets** in **Season 2** of the game.

## Factors That Affect Evolution 📈📉

### Acceleration: PEDs like Roids

Certain items, such as **roids (Performance Enhancing Drugs)**, can speed up the evolution process. For example:

* **Steroids (Roids)**: Increase evolution rate by **1.5x**, reducing the time required to transition between stages. However, this comes at the cost of doubling the heart loss rate (**2x** heart loss).  
* **Coffee**: Does not directly impact evolution speed but reduces the heart loss rate by **1.2x**, which can be useful for survival during stage transitions.

### Slowdowns: SADs and Other Factors

Other items, such as **State Altering Drugs (SADs)**, can **pause or slow down evolution**. For instance:

* **Weed**: Slows evolution by **2x** but also slows heart loss rate by **1.5x**, providing a balance for those focusing on long-term survival.  
* **LSD**: Temporarily pauses the game for **14 days (2016 blocks)**, freezing both heart loss and evolution progress.  
* **DMT**: Provides a high-risk, high-reward mechanic by **instantly evolving your pet to the next stage** or potentially killing it. The success rates vary based on the current stage and are particularly low for evolving to Immortal.

We’ll explore these items and strategies in more detail in the **Game Actions Explained** and **Advanced Strategies** sections.

## Evolution and the Bigger Picture 🌟

Reaching the Immortal stage within Season 1 is a significant achievement. It requires planning, efficient use of game actions, and a clear understanding of how evolution works. While items like **roids** and **DMT** can provide acceleration or dramatic shifts, they come with their own risks and trade-offs.

For players aiming for **Season 2**, evolving all **11 types of pets** to Immortal status will unlock the **breeding feature**, allowing you to create new pets and gain an edge in the next phase of the game.
