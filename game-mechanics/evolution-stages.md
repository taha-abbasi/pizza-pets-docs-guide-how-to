# 💔 Evolution Stages

## 🌟 Evolution Stages Explained

Pizza Pets are more than just static collectibles—they’re living digital pets that grow and evolve through various stages. The evolution process is tied to **Bitcoin block times**, creating a unique and dynamic gameplay experience.

***

## Evolution Stages and Timeline ⏳

There are **six evolution stages** in Pizza Pets:

1. **Egg**
2. **Baby**
3. **Child**
4. **Teen**
5. **Adult**
6. **Immortal**

The total time it takes for a Pizza Pet to reach the **Immortal stage** (without acceleration or roids) is approximately **72 days**, aligned with the length of **Season 1**. The game began on **December 14, 2024**, and with an expected average of 10 minutes per Bitcoin block, Season 1 will conclude 72 days later, on **February 24, 2025**.

## Evolution Chart 📊

The table below outlines the time required for each stage of evolution. It also includes accelerated times with the use of **roids (PEDs)**, though specific strategies for roids will be covered in the **Advanced Strategies** section.

## Evolution Mechanics 🔧

The evolution process happens automatically as blocks are mined and your pet accumulates the required time in each stage. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Egg to Baby**: All Pizza Pets start as eggs and hatch into babies after **288 blocks** (\~2 days).
* **Stage Transitions**: Each stage transition requires a set number of blocks to complete, as shown in the chart.
* **Immortal Stage**: Reaching the Immortal stage is the ultimate goal, unlocking unique traits and high value.

## Factors That Affect Evolution 📈📉

### Acceleration: PEDs like Roids

Certain items, such as **roids (Performance Enhancing Drugs)**, can speed up the evolution process. For example:

* Using roids reduces the block requirements for stage transitions by **33%**, as shown in the “Blocks (With Roids)” column above.

### Slowdowns: SADs and Other Factors

Other items, such as **State Altering Drugs (SADs)**, can **pause or slow down evolution**. For instance:

* **DMT**: Temporarily pauses the game, freezing evolution progress during its effect.

We’ll explore these items and strategies in more detail in the **Advanced Strategies** section.

## Evolution and the Bigger Picture 🌟

Reaching the Immortal stage within Season 1 is a significant achievement. It requires planning, efficient use of game actions, and a clear understanding of how evolution works. While items like **DMT** and **roids** can provide advantages or introduce complexities, mastering these mechanics is key to thriving in Pizza Pets.
