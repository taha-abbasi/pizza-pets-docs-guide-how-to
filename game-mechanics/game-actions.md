## 💪 PEDs (Performance Enhancing Drugs)

PEDs can accelerate evolution, reduce heart loss, or alter gameplay dynamics. However, they come with trade-offs.

| **PED**        | **Effect**                                         | **Side Effect**                                    | **Remove Effects**               |

## 🌀 SADs (State Altering Drugs)

SADs provide powerful effects that can pause the game, evolve pets instantly, or even change their type. These come with significant risks.

| **SAD**         | **Effect**                                        | **Side Effect**                                    | **Remove Effects**               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 🌈 **LSD**       | Pauses game for **14 days (2016 blocks)**         | Kills pet in **14 days (2016 blocks)**            | **Feed Milk Before 2016 Blocks** |
| 🔮 **DMT**       | Instantly evolves pet to the next stage           | Survival chances: **51% for stages up to Adult**, **10% for Adult → Immortal**; otherwise, the pet dies. |                                   |
| 🐎 **Ketamine**  | Changes pet’s **type (ElementalType)**            | **20% chance** the pet dies during transformation. |                                   |
| 🎵 **Molly**     | Reverse evolves pet to the previous stage and restores health to full (all hearts filled). |                                                   |                                   |

## 🚿 Remove Effects

Certain actions can counteract the effects of drugs or resolve other gameplay challenges.

| **Action**  | **Effect**                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚿 **Shower** | Cleans all poop, removing the heart loss multiplier from poop. |
| 🍼 **Milk**   | Removes all active drug effects.                          |

## Understanding Risks and Rewards 🧠

Every action in Pizza Pets is a strategic choice with potential risks and rewards:
- **PEDs** like Coffee and Steroids can accelerate gameplay but increase the need for poop management.
- **SADs** like DMT offer high-risk, high-reward opportunities but can be fatal without careful planning.
- **Remove Effects** actions like Milk and Shower are critical tools for counteracting negative effects and ensuring survival.
