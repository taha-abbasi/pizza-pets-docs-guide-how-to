## üï∞Ô∏è Understanding Game-Time

Pizza Pets uses **Bitcoin block counts** to track time, adding a decentralized twist to gameplay. Unlike real-world clocks, which Ralf claims are rigged by Ninjalerts to confuse players, game-time is all about block mining. Here‚Äôs how it works:

| **Game-Time Unit** | **Number of Bitcoin Blocks** | **Average Real Time** |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **1 Game Hour**     | 6 Blocks                    | ~1 Hour               |
| **1 Game Day**      | 144 Blocks                  | ~1 Day                |
| **1 Game Week**     | 1008 Blocks                 | ~1 Week               |

- **Dynamic Timing**: While a Bitcoin block averages **10 minutes**, actual times can vary greatly, adding an element of unpredictability to gameplay.  
- **Strategic Implications**: Players must think in blocks, not minutes, to master strategies like feeding, evolving, and protecting their pets.
