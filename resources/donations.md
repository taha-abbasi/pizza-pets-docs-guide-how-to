## 🍕 Why Donate?

Running a guide like this takes a village (and a few pizzas). Donations help cover:
- **Hosting Costs**: Platforms like Gitbook allow us to create polished guides, but they come with monthly expenses.  
- **Contributor Time**: Writers, strategists, and testers invest countless hours creating content and refining strategies.  
- **Community Tools**: Resources to help players, such as feeding sites and experimental tools, often require funding.  

Your support enables us to continue creating and sharing valuable resources, so the Pizza Pets world can grow stronger!

## 🐢 A Slice of Gratitude

In the spirit of Ninja Turtles and Bitcoin pizza history:
- Did you know Laszlo Hanyecz traded **10,000 BTC for two pizzas** in 2010? The same spirit of community generosity fuels Pizza Pets and its overlapping communities today.
- Whether you’re on Team Ninjalerts or rooting for Ralf’s pineapple rebellion, your contributions help us build a guide as legendary as Satoshi’s pizza recipe!
