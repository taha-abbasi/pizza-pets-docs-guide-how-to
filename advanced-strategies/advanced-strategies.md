## 🚀 Strategy: Evolve Faster Without Heart Loss or Poop

### **Overview**
This strategy leverages **Cocaine** and **Steroids** to speed up evolution while preventing heart loss for a limited time. However, it comes with significant risks and costs, requiring careful monitoring of block times to avoid losing your pet.

---

### **How It Works**

- **Risk Level**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)  
- **Reward Level**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

By combining **Cocaine** and **Steroids**, you can temporarily bypass heart loss while increasing evolution speed by 1.5x. The trade-offs include:
- The pet will die in **432 blocks (~3 days)** after Cocaine unless fed **Milk**.  
- Feeding Milk also removes the Steroids effect, so the cycle must be repeated.  

---

### **Transaction Cycle**

1. **Feed Cocaine**: Stops heart loss for 432 blocks.  
2. **Feed Steroids**: Speeds up evolution by 1.5x.  
3. **Feed Milk (~400 blocks after Cocaine)**: Must be done before 432 blocks to save the pet.  

#### Repeat the Cycle:
1. Cocaine → 2. Steroids → 3. Milk.  
This reduces evolution time by 1/3rd compared to default gameplay but is costly in terms of resources and transactions.

---

### **Cost Analysis**
This strategy requires more resources than the standard process of feeding **Pizza** or **Beer** and occasionally using **Shower**. It’s best suited for players aiming to expedite evolution in high-stakes scenarios.
