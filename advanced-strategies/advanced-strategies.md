## üöÄ Strategy: Evolve Faster Without Heart Loss or Poop

### **Overview**

This strategy leverages **Cocaine** and **Steroids** to speed up evolution while preventing heart loss for a limited time. However, it comes with significant risks and costs, requiring careful monitoring of block times to avoid losing your pet.

---

### **How It Works**

- **Risk Level**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)  
- **Reward Level**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (2/5)

By combining **Cocaine** and **Steroids**, you can temporarily bypass heart loss while increasing evolution speed by 1.5x. The trade-offs include:

- The pet will die in **432 blocks (\~3 days)** after Cocaine unless fed **Milk**.
- Feeding Milk also removes the Steroids effect, so the cycle must be repeated.

---

### **Transaction Cycle**

1. **Feed Cocaine**: Stops heart loss for 432 blocks.
2. **Feed Steroids**: Speeds up evolution by 1.5x.
3. **Feed Milk (\~400 blocks after Cocaine)**: Must be done before 432 blocks to save the pet.

#### Repeat the Cycle:
Cocaine ‚Üí Steroids ‚Üí Milk.  
This reduces evolution time by 1/3rd compared to default gameplay but is costly in terms of resources and transactions.

---

## **Cost Analysis**

This strategy requires more resources than the standard process of feeding **Pizza** or **Beer** and occasionally using **Shower**. It‚Äôs best suited for players aiming to expedite evolution in high-stakes scenarios.

### Cost Summary for MCS (Milk + Cocaine + Steroids) Strategy

- **TotalBlocks**: 10,080
- **BlocksPerFeedCycle**: 400
- **TotalFeedsNeeded**: 26
- **Number of Transactions per Feed Cycle**: 3
- **CostPerTransaction (sats)**: 20,581
- **Feed Cycle Cost (sats)**: 61,743 (or $58.47 at $94,700 BTC price)
- **Total Cost for Immortal**: 1,520.22 USD

## **Cost Formula Reference**

This section explains the standard formulas used to calculate feeding costs, block cycles, and other game mechanics.

### Formula 1: TotalFeedsNeeded
$$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà TotalBlocks / BlocksPerFeedCycle ‚åâ$$

### Formula 2: CostPerCycle (sats)
$$CostPerCycle (sats) = CostPerTransaction (sats) √ó NumberOfTransactionsPerCycle$$

### Formula 3: CostPerCycle (USD)
$$CostPerCycle (USD) = (CostPerCycle (sats) / BtcPriceInSats) √ó 100,000,000$$

### Formula 4: TotalCost (USD)
$$TotalCost (USD) = CostPerCycle (USD) √ó TotalFeedsNeeded$$

### Parameters
- **BtcPriceInSats** = $$BTC Price in USD √ó 100,000,000$$
- **Fee Rate** = The rate in sats/vByte used for transactions.

### Detailed Breakdown for MCS Strategy

#### Step 1: Determining the Number of Feeding Cycles

To determine how many feeding cycles are required:

$$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà TotalBlocks / BlocksPerFeedCycle ‚åâ$$

**Calculation**:  
$$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà 10,080 / 400 ‚åâ = 26$$

#### Step 2: Cost per Feeding Cycle

Each feed cycle involves **3 transactions** (Milk, Cocaine, and Steroids) to feed **11 pets**:

$$CostPerCycle (sats) = 20,581 √ó 3 = 61,743 \, \text{sats}$$

At the current Bitcoin price of **$94,700**, the dollar value for one cycle is:

1. BtcPriceInSats:  
   $$BtcPriceInSats = 94,700 √ó 100,000,000 = 9,470,000,000,000 \, \text{sats}$$
2. CostPerCycle (USD):  
   $$CostPerCycle (USD) = (61,743 / 9,470,000,000,000) √ó 100,000,000 = 58.47 \, \text{USD}$$

#### Step 3: Total Cost for Immortal Evolution

To calculate the total cost of evolving a pet to the Immortal stage:

$$TotalCost (USD) = 58.47 √ó 26 = 1,520.22 \, \text{USD}$$
