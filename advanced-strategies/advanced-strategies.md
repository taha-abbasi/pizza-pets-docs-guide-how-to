## üöÄ Strategy: Evolve Faster Without Heart Loss or Poop

### **Overview**

This strategy leverages **Cocaine** and **Steroids** to speed up evolution while preventing heart loss for a limited time. However, it comes with significant risks and costs, requiring careful monitoring of block times to avoid losing your pet.

***

### **How It Works**

* **Risk Level**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)
* **Reward Level**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (2/5)

By combining **Cocaine** and **Steroids**, you can temporarily bypass heart loss while increasing evolution speed by 1.5x. The trade-offs include:

* The pet will die in **432 blocks (\~3 days)** after Cocaine unless fed **Milk**.
* Feeding Milk also removes the Steroids effect, so the cycle must be repeated.

***

### **Transaction Cycle**

1. **Feed Cocaine**: Stops heart loss for 432 blocks.
2. **Feed Steroids**: Speeds up evolution by 1.5x.
3. **Feed Milk (\~400 blocks after Cocaine)**: Must be done before 432 blocks to save the pet.

#### Repeat the Cycle:

Cocaine ‚Üí Steroids ‚Üí Milk.\
This reduces evolution time by 1/3rd compared to default gameplay but is costly in terms of resources and transactions.

***

## **Cost Analysis**

This strategy requires more resources than the standard process of feeding **Pizza** or **Beer** and occasionally using **Shower**. It‚Äôs best suited for players aiming to expedite evolution in high-stakes scenarios.

### Key Points

1. **Cost Efficiency for More Pets**\
   Feeding more pets in a single transaction significantly reduces the per-pet cost. For example:
   * **1 Pet Feed Transaction**: Costs **6,131 sats**.
   * **11 Pets Feed Transaction**: Costs **20,581 sats**, reducing the per-pet cost to **1,871 sats**.
2. **Scaling Costs**\
   Feeding strategies become more cost-efficient as the number of pets fed per transaction increases. This can save players significant resources over multiple feed cycles.
3. **Total Costs for Different Stages**\
   Use the tables above to compare costs for evolving 1 pet versus 11 pets across different stages.

## **Cost Formula Reference**

This section explains the standard formulas used to calculate feeding costs, block cycles, and other game mechanics.

### Formula 1: TotalFeedsNeeded

$$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà TotalBlocks / BlocksPerFeedCycle ‚åâ$$

### Formula 2: CostPerCycle (sats)

$$CostPerCycle (sats) = CostPerTransaction (sats) √ó NumberOfTransactionsPerCycle$$

### Formula 3: CostPerCycle (USD)

$$CostPerCycle (USD) = (CostPerCycle (sats) / BtcPriceInSats) √ó 100,000,000$$

### Formula 4: TotalCost (USD)

$$TotalCost (USD) = CostPerCycle (USD) √ó TotalFeedsNeeded$$

### Formula 5: TotalCost (BTC)

$$TotalCost (BTC) = TotalCost (sats) / 100,000,000$$

### Parameters

* **BtcPriceInSats** = $$BTC Price in USD √ó 100,000,000$$
* **Fee Rate** = The rate in sats/vByte used for transactions.

***

### Detailed Breakdown for MCS Strategy

#### Step 1: Determining the Number of Feeding Cycles

**Formula**:\
$$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà TotalBlocks / BlocksPerFeedCycle ‚åâ$$

* **Baby to Immortal**:\
  $$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà 6,720 / 400 ‚åâ = 17$$
* **Child to Immortal**:\
  $$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà 6,048 / 400 ‚åâ = 16$$
* **Teen to Immortal**:\
  $$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà 4,704 / 400 ‚åâ = 12$$
* **Adult to Immortal**:\
  $$TotalFeedsNeeded = ‚åà 2,688 / 400 ‚åâ = 7$$

#### Step 2: Cost per Feeding Cycle

Each feed cycle involves **3 transactions** (Milk, Cocaine, and Steroids):

**Formula**:

* For **11 Pets**:\
  $$CostPerCycle (sats) = 20,581 √ó 3 = 61,743 \, \text{sats}$$
* For **1 Pet**:\
  $$CostPerCycle (sats) = 6,131 √ó 3 = 18,393 \, \text{sats}$$

#### Step 3: Total Cost for Immortal Evolution

**Formula**:\
$$TotalCost (USD) = CostPerCycle (USD) √ó TotalFeedsNeeded$$

* **11 Pets - Baby to Immortal**:\
  $$TotalCost (USD) = 58.47 √ó 17 = 994.04 \, \text{USD}$$
* **1 Pet - Baby to Immortal**:\
  $$TotalCost (USD) = 17.45 √ó 17 = 296.29 \, \text{USD}$$
