# üß† Advanced Strategies

Welcome to the **Advanced Strategies** section, where we delve into creative and high-risk gameplay techniques to optimize your Pizza Pets experience. These strategies often involve **PEDs**, **SADs**, and other game mechanics that require precise planning and timing. Remember, the key to success is balancing risk and reward!

This page will evolve as new strategies are discovered and shared. Stay tuned for updates!

## üöÄ Strategy: Evolve Faster Without Heart Loss or Poop

### **Overview**

This strategy leverages **Cocaine** and **Steroids** to speed up evolution while preventing heart loss for a limited time. However, it comes with significant risks and costs, requiring careful monitoring of block times to avoid losing your pet.

***

### **How It Works**

* **Risk Level**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)
* **Reward Level**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (2/5)

By combining **Cocaine** and **Steroids**, you can temporarily bypass heart loss while increasing evolution speed by 1.5x. The trade-offs include:

* The pet will die in **432 blocks (\~3 days)** after Cocaine unless fed **Milk**.
* Feeding Milk also removes the Steroids effect, so the cycle must be repeated.

***

### **Transaction Cycle**

1. **Feed Cocaine**: Stops heart loss for 432 blocks.
2. **Feed Steroids**: Speeds up evolution by 1.5x.
3. **Feed Milk (\~400 blocks after Cocaine)**: Must be done before 432 blocks to save the pet.

#### Repeat the Cycle:

1. Cocaine ‚Üí 2. Steroids ‚Üí 3. Milk.\
   This reduces evolution time by 1/3rd compared to default gameplay but is costly in terms of resources and transactions.

***

### **Cost Analysis**

This strategy requires more resources than the standard process of feeding **Pizza** or **Beer** and occasionally using **Shower**. It‚Äôs best suited for players aiming to expedite evolution in high-stakes scenarios.

### Cost Matrix For Using MCS Strategy - Baby to Immortal

This cost matrix calculates the cost of evolving your Pizza Pets from **Baby** to **Immortal** using the **Milk + Cocaine + Steroids (MCS)** strategy. The evolution process spans **10,080 blocks**, and the feeding cycle needs to be repeated every **400 blocks**.

***

### Step 1: Determining the Number of Feeding Cycles

To determine how many feeding cycles are required:

#### Formula:

$$Total Feeds Needed = ‚åà Total Blocks / Blocks per Feed Cycle ‚åâ$$

#### Calculation:

$$Total Feeds Needed = ‚åà 10,080 / 400 ‚åâ = ‚åà 25.2 ‚åâ = 26$$

Thus, **26 feeding cycles** are needed.

***

### Step 2: Cost per Feeding Cycle

Each feed cycle involves **3 transactions** (Milk, Cocaine, and Steroids) to feed **11 pets**. The cost per transaction is **20,581 sats at a fee rate of 5 sats/vByte**, and the total cost for one cycle is:

#### Formula:

$$Cost per Cycle (sats) = Cost per Transaction (sats) √ó Number of Transactions per Cycle$$

#### Calculation:

$$Cost per Cycle (sats) = 20,581 √ó 3 = 61,743 sats$$

At the current Bitcoin price of **$94,700**, the dollar value for one feed cycle is:

#### Formula:

$$Cost per Cycle (USD) = (Cost per Cycle (sats) / BtcPriceInSats) √ó 100,000,000$$

$$BtcPriceInSats = BtcPriceInUSD √ó 100,000,000$$

#### Calculation:

1. BTC Price in Sats: \
   $$BtcPriceInSats = 94,700 √ó 100,000,000 = 9,470,000,000,000 sats$$
2. Cost per Cycle (USD): \
   $$CostPerCycle (USD) = (61,743 / 9,470,000,000,000) √ó 100,000,000 = 58.47 USD$$

Thus, the cost per feeding cycle at a **fee rate of 5 sats/vByte** is **$58.47**.

***

### Step 3: Total Cost for the Immortal Evolution

To calculate the total cost of evolving a pet to the Immortal stage, multiply the cost per feeding cycle by the total number of feeding cycles.

#### Formula:

$$Total Cost (USD) = Cost per Cycle (USD) √ó Total Feeds Needed$$

#### Calculation:

$$Total Cost (USD) = 58.47 √ó 26 = 1,520.22 USD$$

### Step 4: Summary Table

| **Parameter**               | **Value**                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Total Blocks                | 10,080                                 |
| Blocks per Feed Cycle       | 400                                    |
| Total Feeds Needed          | 26                                     |
| Cost per Transaction (sats) | 20,581                                 |
| Feed Cycle Cost (3 tx)      | 61,743 sats ($58.47 at $94,700 BTC)    |
| Total Cost for Immortal     | 1,520.22 USD                           |

***

### Key Points

1. **Each feeding cycle involves three transactions (Milk, Cocaine, Steroids) for all 11 pets.**
2. **One feeding cycle costs 61,743 sats, or $58.47 at the current Bitcoin price of $94,700.**
3. **A total of 26 feeding cycles is required, resulting in a final cost of $1,520.22.**

This cost matrix provides clarity for planning the MCS feeding strategy. Adjustments can be made if Bitcoin price or transaction fees fluctuate. Always ensure you have sufficient sats before starting the evolution process!
