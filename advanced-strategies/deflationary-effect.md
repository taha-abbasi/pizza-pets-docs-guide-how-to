# 🔥 The Deflationary Effect

## 🍕 A Deflationary World of Pizza Pets

Pizza Pets operates on a unique **deflationary mechanic** where the supply of pets decreases over time, permanently impacting the ecosystem. Dead pets are **forever removed from collections**, making survivors increasingly rare and valuable. Let’s explore how this deflationary effect plays out.

## 📉 The Numbers Behind Deflation

Pizza Pets launched with an initial supply of **over 58,200 pets**, distributed across **400+ communities**. However, as gameplay progresses, the number of pets in circulation is steadily declining.

### The Pizza Pets Halving 🍕

On **19-December-2024**, a pivotal moment in the Pizza Pets world occurred: the **Pizza Pets Halving**. Over a span of just **4 hours**, a staggering **33,725 pets** died, meaning **over half the supply permanently bit the dust**.

- **Initial Supply**: ~58,200 pets.  
- **Deaths During Halving**: 33,725 pets.  
- **Supply Remaining Post-Halving**: ~24,475 pets.

This dramatic event caused a significant increase in value:
- The floor price for Pizza Pets has increased by nearly **5x** since the Halving.  
- And the **Pet Pulverizer** hasn’t even entered the game yet.

## 🕹️ The Gameplay Engine’s Role

The sophisticated gameplay engine of Pizza Pets ensures a constant challenge for players:
- Pets die regularly due to **poop mismanagement**, **heart loss**, and **strategic missteps**.  
- Advanced mechanics like **PEDs**, **SADs**, and the **Pet Pulverizer** will continue to impact survival rates.

Even I’ve lost pets due to a mistake in my **pet milk alarm**. I missed the critical **death block time** by 3 hours. Here’s the story I shared:

This ongoing deflation means the supply of pets will keep decreasing, increasing the rarity and potential value of surviving pets.

## 📈 The Impact of Deflation on Value

As the supply of Pizza Pets decreases:
- **Rarity Increases**: Surviving pets become more valuable as they represent a shrinking pool of assets.  
- **Demand Grows**: Collectors and players seek out surviving pets for gameplay and future mechanics like **breeding in Season 2**.  
- **Strategic Gameplay Becomes Critical**: The ability to keep pets alive while navigating deflationary pressures becomes a key competitive edge.
