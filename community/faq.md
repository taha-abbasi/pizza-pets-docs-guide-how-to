## üêæ Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: What are Pizza Pets, and how do they work?**

Pizza Pets are **Tamagotchi-style digital pets** that evolve, require care, and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. Players must manage their pets‚Äô health, feeding, and evolution stages to keep them alive and thriving.

***

### **Q: How do I feed my pets?**

You can feed your pets using the available feeding sites:

* **Official Feeding Site**: [pizzapets.fun](https://www.pizzapets.fun/)
* [**@lifofifo**](https://x.com/lifofifo)**‚Äôs Feeding Site**: [pets.inscribe.dev](https://pets.inscribe.dev/)

### **Q: What is Game-Time, and How Does It Work?**

In **Pizza Pets**, _Game-Time_ is measured using **Bitcoin block counts** instead of real-world time, introducing a dynamic and decentralized timing mechanism. Here's how it works:

* **1 Game Hour** = **6 Bitcoin Blocks** (\~1 hour)
* **1 Game Day** = **144 Bitcoin Blocks** (\~1 day)
* **1 Game Week** = **1,008 Bitcoin Blocks** (\~1 week)

{% hint style="info" %}
Time estimates assume an average of 10 minutes per Bitcoin block. However, actual block times can vary due to network conditions. This means a "game hour" might take 30 minutes or several hours, making _Game-Time_ more **dynamic and unpredictable** compared to fixed real-world time.
{% endhint %}

This variability adds an exciting element of spontaneity and unpredictability to the gameplay experience.

***

### **Q: Why does the game use Bitcoin blocks instead of real time?**

Using Bitcoin blocks ensures a **decentralized, dynamic experience**. Unlike fixed clocks, block times vary, creating unpredictability in gameplay. It‚Äôs part of the challenge‚Äîand the fun!

***

### **Q: How many pets are alive, dead, and in circulation?**

The current statistics for **alive pets**, **dead pets**, and the **total number of pets in circulation** are updated live and can be viewed at the [Pizza Pets Dashboard](https://www.pizzapets.fun/dashboard).

***

### **Q: How does the deflationary mechanic work?**

When a pet dies, it is **permanently removed** from the collection, reducing the overall supply. This deflationary effect increases the rarity of surviving pets, impacting their value in the ecosystem. See more in the dedicated page:

{% content-ref url="../advanced-strategies/deflationary-effect.md" %}
[deflationary-effect.md](../advanced-strategies/deflationary-effect.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

***

### **Q: What happens if my pet poops and I don‚Äôt clean it?**

Uncleaned poop increases your pet‚Äôs **heart loss rate** from 1 heart per day to **1.4 hearts per day per poop**. Multiple poops can stack, leading to faster heart loss. Use a **Shower** to clean poop and reset the heart loss rate to normal. See details in:

[Evolution Stages](../game-mechanics/poop-management.md#the-consequences-of-poop)

***

### **Q: Can I feed Cocaine and Steroids in one transaction?**

üö´ No! Certain items, like **Cocaine** and **Steroids**, cannot be combined in a single transaction. Both feeding sites have safeguards to prevent this:

* **Official Feeding Site**: [pizzapets.fun](https://www.pizzapets.fun/)
* [**@lifofifo**](https://x.com/lifofifo)**‚Äôs Feeding Site**: [pets.inscribe.dev](https://pets.inscribe.dev/)

To achieve the best results, **feed Cocaine first**, followed by Steroids in a separate transaction. Just remember: this isn‚Äôt the **Ninja Turtle Power Combo** you might think it is‚Äîuse responsibly!

***

### **Q: Can I feed Steroids multiple times to increase evolution rates?**

üö´ No! **Steroids do not stack**. Feeding them multiple times will only waste your extra transactions (and potentially your pet‚Äôs patience). This is more like trying to double-spend on Bitcoin‚Äîit won‚Äôt work.

***

### **Q: Can I bring a dead pet back to life?**

No. Once a pet dies, it is permanently removed from the collection. The deflationary nature of the game is core to its design.

***

### **Q: How do I protect my pets from the Pet Pulverizer?**

Apply **Lotion** to pets that match the Pulverizer‚Äôs type (e.g., Yellow Pineapple Weakness) to protect them. Pets with **Immune traits**, as well as those in the Egg, Baby, or Immortal stages, are naturally safe. See more in:

{% content-ref url="../game-mechanics/pet-pulverizer.md" %}
[pet-pulverizer.md](../game-mechanics/pet-pulverizer.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

***

### **Q: How do I use Milk to counteract drug effects?**

Milk removes all active drug effects:

* Feed Milk before the specified block deadline for drugs like **Cocaine** or **LSD** to prevent fatal outcomes.
* For other drugs like **Steroids** or **Coffee**, Milk can be used anytime to reset effects. See more in:

{% content-ref url="../game-mechanics/game-actions.md" %}
[game-actions.md](../game-mechanics/game-actions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

***

### **Q: My pet died because I missed the Milk block deadline. What can I do?**

Unfortunately, there is no way to recover a dead pet. Set alarms or reminders for critical block deadlines to avoid missing them in the future. Tools like [Mind Your Milk](https://www.mindyourmilk.pizza/) by [@0xBGoat](https://x.com/0xBGoat) can help you set reminders to avoid this mistake.

***

### **Q: My pets disappeared after I submitted a feed or game action transaction. Where did they go?**

The feed and game actions are an **ordinal inscription**, which requires a **commit** and **reveal** transaction. During this stage, the feeding sites will show your pets in the mempool. Once the transaction is confirmed, the pets will return to your account.

If you experience issues, reach out to the Ninjalerts team on Discord for support: [discord.com/invite/pizzaninjas](https://discord.com/invite/pizzaninjas).

***

### **Q: If my pet is on a drug that has a kill or death block such as Cocaine, LSD, etc., can I just feed it the same drug again before the death block arrives to extend the death block further?**

**A:**\
No, you cannot extend the death block by feeding the same drug again. To apply a new death block:

1. **Feed Milk** to remove the existing drug effect and its associated death block.
2. Then, **feed the drug again** to create a new effect and establish a new death block.

Ralf might argue this is part of Ninjalerts‚Äô grand scheme to limit your pets‚Äô potential, but we know the real story: it‚Äôs all about strategy! Timing is everything‚Äîjust like planning your next Bitcoin transaction in a congested mempool.

***

### **Q: Can I give my pet a Shower in the same block poop is incoming?**

**A:**\
No, it will waste the Shower. The poop block needs to **confirm first** before the Shower is applied. Attempting to Shower in the same block will have no effect because the game mechanics require the poop status to be fully confirmed on-chain.

Think of it as waiting for your Bitcoin transaction to finalize before calling it ‚Äúconfirmed.‚Äù Ralf might say Ninjalerts made the rules to keep him busy cleaning up moon cheese crumbs, but Pizza Ninjas know it‚Äôs just the game‚Äôs way of keeping us sharp.

***

### **Q: Can I feed my pet in the same block it‚Äôs projected to die to save the pet?**

**A:**\
Yes, but it‚Äôs risky. If your feed or Milk transaction confirms **in the same block as the pet‚Äôs death block**, it will save the pet. This applies to:

* Pets dying due to heart health loss.
* Pets on drugs like Cocaine or LSD with a death block.

However, this requires precise timing, as the transaction must be confirmed **within the same block**. Ralf might call this high-stakes gambling (and he‚Äôd be right), but Bitcoiners know it‚Äôs all about precision and mempool management. Channel your inner Pizza Ninja and aim for perfect timing!

***

### **Q: What happens when a Pulverizer is triggered?**

**A:**\
When a Pulverizer is triggered:
- A **pineapple icon** matching the Pulverizer‚Äôs color (e.g., Yellow) will appear on all pets.
- Alerts will be sent on platforms like X and apps such as [Mind Your Milk](https://www.mindyourmilk.pizza/).

You don‚Äôt need to act immediately. The Pulverizer **detonates 72 blocks (~12 hours)** after the trigger block.

***

### **Q: Will all pets die when a Pulverizer detonates?**

**A:**\
No, only pets with the **same Pineapple Weakness color** as the triggered Pulverizer are at risk. For example:
- A Yellow Pulverizer will kill pets with **Yellow Pineapple Weakness**, unless protected with Lotion.

**Safe Pets**:
- Pets in evolution stages **Egg**, **Baby**, or **Immortal**.
- Pets with **Immunity**.
- Pets with a Pineapple Weakness of a **different color**.

***

### **Q: How do I protect my pets from a Pulverizer?**

**A:**\
The only way to protect vulnerable pets is by applying **Lotion**. Follow these steps:
1. **Wait Until Detonation Is ~32 Blocks Away**: Lotion lasts for **36 blocks**, so timing is critical.
2. **Apply Lotion to Vulnerable Pets**: Only pets with the **same Pineapple Weakness color** as the Pulverizer need protection.

Avoid applying Lotion too early, as its effect may wear off before the detonation block.

***

### **Q: What happens if I give Milk to my pet after applying Lotion?**

**A:**\
Milk removes **all active effects**, including Lotion. If you feed Milk to a pet after applying Lotion, you must reapply Lotion to protect your pet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be cautious when using strategies that involve PEDs like Cocaine and Steroids, as Milk will remove Lotion and leave your pet vulnerable.
{% endhint %}

***

### **Q: Can I stack Lotion to extend its duration?**

**A:**\
No, Lotion cannot be stacked. Each application lasts for **36 blocks**, so plan carefully to ensure your pet remains protected through the detonation block.

***

### **Q: How do I check my pet‚Äôs Pineapple Weakness?**

**A:**\
To determine your pet‚Äôs vulnerability:
1. Open your pet‚Äôs **Stats** menu.
2. Look for the **Weakness** stat, which will show if your pet is vulnerable to Yellow, Green, Red, White, Blue, or Black Pineapple Weakness.

***

### **Q: How long do I have to act after a Pulverizer is triggered?**

**A:**\
The Pulverizer detonates **72 blocks (~12 hours)** after it is triggered. Monitor block progress carefully, as mining times can vary. Apply Lotion when **‚â§32 blocks remain** to ensure your pet is protected.

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about block timing in [Game-Time Explained](../resources/timeline-and-seasons.md#understanding-game-time).
{% endhint %}

***

### **Q: Is a pet on LSD safe from the Pulverizer?**

**A:**\
No, pets on LSD are not immune to the Pulverizer. You must still apply Lotion to protect them, following the timing recommendations for maximum effectiveness.

***

### **Q: Can a Pulverizer be used more than once?**

**A:**\
Yes, Pulverizers can be used an **unlimited number of times**. However, after each use, they must go through a **Recharge Period** before they can be triggered again:

| **Pulverizer Color** | **Recharge Period** |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| White                | **5 Weeks**         |
| Black & Yellow       | **6 Weeks**         |
| Red, Green, & Blue   | **7 Weeks**         |

{% hint style="info" %}
Recharge periods are measured in **game-time** (Bitcoin blocks). Learn more about game-time mechanics in [Game-Time Explained](../resources/timeline-and-seasons.md#understanding-game-time).
{% endhint %}

***

### **Q: Can I shower my pet on the same block as detonation to save it?**

**A:**\
No. A Shower cannot protect a pet from the Pulverizer. Only Lotion applied before detonation will save a vulnerable pet.

***

### **Q: What should I do if I miss applying Lotion before detonation?**

**A:**\
Unfortunately, if a vulnerable pet does not have Lotion applied at the detonation block, it will die. Set alerts or use tools like [Mind Your Milk](https://www.mindyourmilk.pizza/) to ensure you apply Lotion in time.
