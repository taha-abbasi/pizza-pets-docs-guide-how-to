## 🐾 Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: What are Pizza Pets, and how do they work?**
Pizza Pets are **Tamagotchi-style digital pets** that evolve, require care, and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. Players must manage their pets’ health, feeding, and evolution stages to keep them alive and thriving.

### **Q: How does the deflationary mechanic work?**
When a pet dies, it is **permanently removed** from the collection, reducing the overall supply. This deflationary effect increases the rarity of surviving pets, impacting their value in the ecosystem. See more in the dedicated page:

### **Q: What happens if my pet poops and I don’t clean it?**
Uncleaned poop increases your pet’s **heart loss rate** from 1 heart per day to **1.4 hearts per day per poop**. Multiple poops can stack, leading to faster heart loss. Use a **Shower** to clean poop and reset the heart loss rate to normal. See details in:

[Evolution Stages](../game-mechanics/evolution-stages.md#poop-frequency-and-timing)

### **Q: Can I feed Cocaine and Steroids in one transaction?**
🚫 No! Certain items, like **Cocaine** and **Steroids**, cannot be combined in a single transaction. Both feeding sites have safeguards to prevent this:
- **Official Feeding Site**: [pizzapets.fun](https://www.pizzapets.fun/)
- **@lifofifo’s Feeding Site**: [pets.inscribe.dev](https://pets.inscribe.dev/)

To achieve the best results, **feed Cocaine first**, followed by Steroids in a separate transaction. Just remember: this isn’t the **Ninja Turtle Power Combo** you might think it is—use responsibly!

---

### **Q: Can I feed Steroids multiple times to increase evolution rates?**
🚫 No! **Steroids do not stack**. Feeding them multiple times will only waste your extra transactions (and potentially your pet’s patience). This is more like trying to double-spend on Bitcoin—it won’t work.

---

### **Q: Can I bring a dead pet back to life?**
No. Once a pet dies, it is permanently removed from the collection. The deflationary nature of the game is core to its design.

---

### **Q: How do I protect my pets from the Pet Pulverizer?**
Apply **Lotion** to pets that match the Pulverizer’s type (e.g., Yellow Pineapple Weakness) to protect them. Pets with **Immune traits**, as well as those in the Egg, Baby, or Immortal stages, are naturally safe. See more in:

---

### **Q: How do I use Milk to counteract drug effects?**
Milk removes all active drug effects:
- Feed Milk before the specified block deadline for drugs like **Cocaine** or **LSD** to prevent fatal outcomes.
- For other drugs like **Steroids** or **Coffee**, Milk can be used anytime to reset effects. See more in:

{% content-ref url="../game-mechanics/game-actions.md" %}
[game-actions.md](../game-mechanics/game-actions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

---

### **Q: My pet died because I missed the Milk block deadline. What can I do?**
Unfortunately, there is no way to recover a dead pet. Set alarms or reminders for critical block deadlines to avoid missing them in the future. Tools like [Mind Your Milk](https://www.mindyourmilk.pizza/) by @0xBGoat can help you set reminders to avoid this mistake.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: My feeding transaction failed. What should I do?**
- **Solution**: Check the mempool to see if the transaction is pending or has been replaced by a higher fee transaction. If it’s not appearing, try resubmitting the transaction with a higher fee.
