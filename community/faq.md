## 🐾 Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: What are Pizza Pets, and how do they work?**

Pizza Pets are **Tamagotchi-style digital pets** that evolve, require care, and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. Players must manage their pets’ health, feeding, and evolution stages to keep them alive and thriving.

***

### **Q: How many pets are alive, dead, and in circulation?**

The current statistics for **alive pets**, **dead pets**, and the **total number of pets in circulation** are updated live and can be viewed at the [Pizza Pets Dashboard](https://www.pizzapets.fun/dashboard).

***

### **Q: How does the deflationary mechanic work?**

When a pet dies, it is **permanently removed** from the collection, reducing the overall supply. This deflationary effect increases the rarity of surviving pets, impacting their value in the ecosystem. See more in the dedicated page:

### **Q: What happens if my pet poops and I don’t clean it?**

Uncleaned poop increases your pet’s **heart loss rate** from 1 heart per day to **1.4 hearts per day per poop**. Multiple poops can stack, leading to faster heart loss. Use a **Shower** to clean poop and reset the heart loss rate to normal. See details in:

[Evolution Stages](../game-mechanics/poop-management.md#the-consequences-of-poop)

### **Q: Can I feed Cocaine and Steroids in one transaction?**

🚫 No! Certain items, like **Cocaine** and **Steroids**, cannot be combined in a single transaction. Both feeding sites have safeguards to prevent this:

* **Official Feeding Site**: [pizzapets.fun](https://www.pizzapets.fun/)
* [**@lifofifo**](https://x.com/lifofifo)**’s Feeding Site**: [pets.inscribe.dev](https://pets.inscribe.dev/)

To achieve the best results, **feed Cocaine first**, followed by Steroids in a separate transaction. Just remember: this isn’t the **Ninja Turtle Power Combo** you might think it is—use responsibly!

***

### **Q: Can I feed Steroids multiple times to increase evolution rates?**

🚫 No! **Steroids do not stack**. Feeding them multiple times will only waste your extra transactions (and potentially your pet’s patience). This is more like trying to double-spend on Bitcoin—it won’t work.

***

### **Q: Can I bring a dead pet back to life?**

No. Once a pet dies, it is permanently removed from the collection. The deflationary nature of the game is core to its design.

***

### **Q: How do I protect my pets from the Pet Pulverizer?**

Apply **Lotion** to pets that match the Pulverizer’s type (e.g., Yellow Pineapple Weakness) to protect them. Pets with **Immune traits**, as well as those in the Egg, Baby, or Immortal stages, are naturally safe. See more in:

[pet-pulverizer.md](../game-mechanics/pet-pulverizer.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

***

### **Q: How do I use Milk to counteract drug effects?**

Milk removes all active drug effects:

* Feed Milk before the specified block deadline for drugs like **Cocaine** or **LSD** to prevent fatal outcomes.
* For other drugs like **Steroids** or **Coffee**, Milk can be used anytime to reset effects. See more in:

{% content-ref url="../game-mechanics/game-actions.md" %}
[game-actions.md](../game-mechanics/game-actions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

***

### **Q: My pet died because I missed the Milk block deadline. What can I do?**

Unfortunately, there is no way to recover a dead pet. Set alarms or reminders for critical block deadlines to avoid missing them in the future. Tools like [Mind Your Milk](https://www.mindyourmilk.pizza/) by [@0xBGoat](https://x.com/0xBGoat) can help you set reminders to avoid this mistake.

***

### **Q: My pets disappeared after I submitted a feed or game action transaction. Where did they go?**

The feed and game actions are an **ordinal inscription**, which requires a **commit** and **reveal** transaction. During this stage, the feeding sites will show your pets in the mempool. Once the transaction is confirmed, the pets will return to your account.
